Problem Statement:
Implement a spam/ham classifier using Na√Øve Bayes Multinomial Algorithm, remove all the stop words and use stemming to make the model more accurate. Report all the accuracies by comparing test set after training with train set.

Run the program by:
 python main.py

Output:
Accuracy for test before filtering stop words:
0.9414225941422594
Accuracy for test after filtering stop words:
0.9393305439330544
